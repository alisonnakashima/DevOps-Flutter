# simple_task_list

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a study case to CI/CD with a Flutter application. 
The main intention here is to learn how to create and configure a CI/CD pipeline.
_________________________________________________________________

The tool selected was Github Actions. So, on consequence, there are some configurations
on the file CI-CD.yaml on the path .github/workflows.

There is a test file on the project that generates an error on the workflow. This is
task_failure_test.dart, on line 16 and 17 you can comment one of them to make the 
CI/CD works good or identify an error.
